✔ Project Overview: This project involved creating a dynamic sales analysis dashboard for a quick commerce platform (Blinkit). The dashboard centralizes key operational and financial metrics, allowing for strategic analysis of product performance, outlet efficiency, and the impact of fat content on sales. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable intelligence for inventory management and store location strategy.

✔ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
  ➡ Total Sales: $1.20M (Overall gross revenue across all outlets and items)
  ➡ Average Sales: $141 (Average transaction value or average sales per item/outlet)
  ➡ Number of Items: 8523 (Total unique items or item categories in the analysis)
  ➡ Average Rating: 4.0 (Overall customer satisfaction score)

✔ Project Execution (The STAR Method): 
   ➡ Business Challenge Defined / Situation: The business required a clear view of sales drivers, particularly how outlet size, location tiers, and item characteristics (like Fat Content) influence total sales and revenue generation.
   ➡ Solution Objective / Task: Design a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to analyze sales distribution across Outlet Size, Outlet Location Tier, and Item Type, and track annual establishment trends.
   ➡ Project Implementation / Action: Structured and modeled the data to link sales figures to specific outlet attributes. Created detailed visualizations including donut charts for Outlet Size and Fat Content, and bar charts for Item Type, ensuring dynamic filtering via the Filter Panel.
   ➡ Measurable Business Outcomes / Result: Tier 3 locations generate the highest sales $472.1K. Regular Fat items are the primary sales driver 65%. This enabled focused inventory stocking and real estate strategy.

✔ Technology Stack:
   ➡ Core Tools: Microsoft Excel (for data manipulation and visualization)
   ➡ Skills: Data Modeling, Business Requirements Analysis (BRD), KPI Development, Data Visualization, and Interactive Dashboard Design.

✔ Conclusion & Value Delivered: This project successfully delivered a robust and flexible analytics platform that provides leadership with the tools to monitor performance in real-time and make data-backed strategic decisions. By centralizing ₹53.01M in sales data, the dashboard moves the organization from reactive reporting to proactive forecasting and optimized resource deployment across all sales territories.
